We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. If you're adding or fixing translations, edit locale files in config/locales.

3. If you're making a Ruby change, add tests for your change.

4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
